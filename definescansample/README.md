# Define Scan Sample

Make a list of candidate events for our flash-tuning sample

Use `../draw_vtx_images` to make the pictures (runs on tufts)

Game Plane

* collect best 100 1l1p examples
* verify visually the accurqacy of that reconstruction
* collect a few hundred examples through scanning
* use the scanning examples to tune the flash-match parameters
* overall scale, 32 relative scaling factors
* do the same for MC
* compare the chi^2 distribution
* define the cuts -- data/mc disagreement will be a problem?
* data-driven a possibility?

* start with bnb numu
